"""Which lines of a module its suite reached at one revision and no longer reaches at another.

    python3 tools/reach-diff.py <module> <suite> --base <rev> --head <rev>
        [--repo PATH] [--jobs N] [--timeout S] [--tracer monitoring|settrace]

e.g. python3 tools/reach-diff.py plugins/audit/scripts/governance/drive-phase.py \\
         tests/test_drive_phase.py --base 92c399f5 --head HEAD

WHY THIS EXISTS. A suite converted from end-to-end drives to unit cases over a
decision function keeps its decisions tested and can stop running the code that ACTS
on a decision - the branch that routes to the answer, the line that appends what the
answer printed. Nothing about the converted suite looks wrong: every case passes and
every case is about the planner. Reviews found that shape by reading, one instance at
a time, and a reader finds the instances they think to look for. This is the
invariant instead: every line of the module the old suite reached, the new suite
still reaches, or the line is named. It is the check a conversion owes.

HOW A REVISION IS MEASURED. Each revision is a `git archive` export into a scratch
directory (the checkout is never written, and no worktree is registered in its git
dir). The suite is run there the way the sweep runs it - the sweep's own `run_one`
and `grade`, loaded rather than copied, so the child's cwd, temp, home, git config and
session filtering are the sweep's - one job per `STAGES` block (`--selftest --stage
LABEL`), or the whole file when the sweep cannot read a table, with the jobs of both
revisions in one pool sized by the sweep's `default_jobs`. A line tracer is installed
in EVERY Python process that run starts, children included, by a `sitecustomize`
module in a scratch directory put first on `PYTHONPATH`; it runs the sitecustomize it
shadows (a Homebrew Python has one), and it records only lines whose code object's
file is the module, by resolved path - `sys.monitoring` where the interpreter has it,
each location disabled after its first event so the cost elsewhere is one call per
location, and `sys.settrace` plus `threading.settrace` on the 3.8 floor, which hands
a line tracer only to the module's frames. Each process writes its lines at exit.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, SAID RATHER THAN IMPLIED. A process that does not run the hook:
one started with `-I`, `-E` or `-S`, one handed an environment without
`PYTHONPATH` or the two variables naming the module and the output directory, and
one whose interpreter has another `sitecustomize` earlier on its path. A process
that never reaches its exit handlers: `os._exit`, a kill, a timeout, a fork that
ends without returning. Lines reached in those processes are absent at BOTH
revisions alike when the suite's shape is the same, and absent at one only when the
conversion changed how the module is run - so the count of processes traced at each
revision is printed beside the lines, and a big difference there is the first thing
to read. A suite that reads the repository's own git (history, `ls-files`) sees an
export with none.

HOW A LINE IS MATCHED ACROSS REVISIONS. By its enclosing function (dotted, from the
AST, `<module>` outside any), its stripped text, and which occurrence of that text in
that function it is - never by its number, so a change that only moves code compares
equal. A line reached at the base whose key the head's module no longer holds was
changed or deleted rather than left unreached; such lines are listed apart as gone,
and do not decide the exit code - a renamed function therefore hides its lines from
the comparison, and the gone list is where that shows.

A RUN THAT MEASURED NOTHING IS NOT A PASS. Any block that failed - a red case, a
crash, a timeout, no contract line - or a revision at which no line of the module
was reached at all, refuses with 2 and says which: a reach measured over a suite
that did not finish is not the suite's reach.

Exit codes: 0 no line lost - 1 a line lost - 2 usage error, or no comparison made.
