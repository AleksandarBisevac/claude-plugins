"""
Where a test-execution evidence record lives, and what it is allowed to say.

The gate runner already answers the two questions an exit code cannot -- did the
gate change the tree, and did anything actually run -- and then throws every one
of those answers away: `run-test-gate.py` performs no disk I/O at all. This module
is the memory it never had.

WHY NOT THE JOURNAL. `_journal_io.DETAILS_KEYS` is an allow-list, and the three
tests it states for a new key are that the key names A FIELD OF THE PLAN that
moved, that it is bounded, and that it exposes nothing new. An exit code, a
duration and a check count fail the first outright -- they are things the plugin
OBSERVED ABOUT THE MACHINE -- and `MAX_DETAILS_BYTES` would clip a multi-step run
besides. So the runs live here and the journal ANCHORS them: one row per recorded
run naming its `runId`, which is a plan field and passes all three.

WHY NOT THE USAGE LEDGER'S HOME EITHER. `<ledgerDir>` is local scratch that writes
its own `.gitignore`; this is evidence for an audit somebody hands to a client, so
it sits beside the manifest and is COMMITTED, exactly like the journal. The two
differ in what they are for, not in where they belong.

FILE LAYOUT
    <evidence dir>/<YYYY-MM>.<writerId>.jsonl     (default <manifest dir>/evidence)

One file per writer per month, which is the journal's argument and not a
decoration: two sessions in two git worktrees append at the same time, and a
single shared file would conflict on every merge -- the one thing the sharded
manifest layout exists to avoid. The writer id and the month come from
`_journal_io`, so the two records name the same writer the same way.

This module carries no `--selftest` of its own; its cases live in
`plugins/audit/tests/test__evidence_io.py` -- see `plugins/audit/tests/_harness.py`.
