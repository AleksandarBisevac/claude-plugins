"""
Terminal output that cannot be killed by a character it cannot spell — stdlib only.

Python does not degrade an unprintable character; it raises. When stdout is a PIPE on
Windows, its encoding is the machine's legacy code page (cp1252 on a US/EU runner), and
`print("✓")` there is not a missing tick — it is a `UnicodeEncodeError`, a traceback and
a non-zero exit, with everything the command was going to say still unsaid.

The console is not the problem: Python has written UTF-8 to the Windows console since
3.6. Only redirected output falls back to the code page, which is why this is invisible
until someone pipes, tees or captures — and CI captures everything.

`safe_stdio()` is the whole fix: reconfigure both streams to UTF-8, and set the error
handler to `replace` so that even a stream that cannot be reconfigured, or a consumer
that really is cp1252, gets a `?` instead of a crash. UTF-8 first and `replace` second is
deliberate — the common case (a UTF-8 capable consumer) gets the real character, and the
impossible case degrades one glyph instead of losing the whole run.

WHERE IT APPLIES. Every entry point under `scripts/` calls it as its first statement, and
that is enforced rather than remembered: `entries_missing_guard()` reads the directory and
names any `__main__` block that does not, so the selftest CI already runs fails the moment
a new script forgets. Ordering matters as much as adoption — the guard has to run before
the first `print`, so a script that calls it late is a script that still crashes on its
first line of output.

`hooks/` deliberately does NOT import this. A hook's product output is `json.dumps`, which
is `ensure_ascii` by default and therefore pure ASCII by construction; its only other
output is its own selftest. Keeping the hooks importless is worth more than the guard —
they run on every tool call, from a launcher that may not have this directory on its path.
CI runs the whole selftest sweep a second time under `PYTHONIOENCODING=cp1252`, which is
what actually covers them, and would catch a hook that started printing prose with a glyph
in it.
