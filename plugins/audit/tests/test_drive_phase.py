"""Cases for `governance/drive-phase.py`.

WHAT THIS FILE IS ABOUT, in one line: the main loop used to run every step of a
task itself - start, the brief, the gate, the stamp, the reviewer's brief, the
commit, the close - one request each, and the step driver runs every step that
needs no judgement so the main loop makes four requests a task.

EVERY DRIVE HERE IS REAL. The fixture is a committed git repository with a
three-task, one-wave plan, and the driver calls the real verbs as subprocesses:
`audit-task.py`, `audit-lookup.py`, `run-test-gate.py`, `stamp-verification.py`,
`commit-task-work.py` and `audit-lock.py`. The test plays the main loop: it
calls `next`, and when told to dispatch an agent it plays that agent by making
the agent's last act, `drive-phase.py submit`, as a command - which takes the
stamp and files through `audit-task.py file-return`, the one door a return is
written through. The `ds` cases hold `submit` itself: each refusal writes
nothing, and each has the twin that files.

EACH PROPERTY IS SHOWN RED AGAINST A MUTATED DRIVER, inside this suite: a fresh
copy of the module is loaded, one function is replaced with the defect the
property exists against, and the same predicate that holds for the real driver
must fail for the mutant. A predicate that the mutant also satisfies would be
asserting nothing, and the twin is what says so.
